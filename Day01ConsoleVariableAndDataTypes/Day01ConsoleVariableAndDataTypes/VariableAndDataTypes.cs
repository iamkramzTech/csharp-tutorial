        //In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:
        //int - stores integers(whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
        //double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
        //char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
        //string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
        //bool - stores values with two states: true or false

        //Format in Declaring (Creating Variables)
        //  <type> variableName = value;
        //Example:
        string name = "John";
        string greetings = "Hello";
        int age = 26;
        bool isHandsome = false; // data type for true or false
